<b>Background</b>
I am an immigrant, and a Civil Engineer by trade. Since 2015, I have entered into th world of Data Analytics and Data Science, self-taught programming, SQL, and Business Intelligence tools and techniques. I find engineering and math fascinating. Learning and playing with my kids are the two most enjoyable activities and most fun when they happen at the same time!
